# Motion Profile
## What is Motion Profile?
A motion profile, in the context of robotics and motion control, refers to a specific trajectory or path that describes how a system's position, velocity, and acceleration change over time. It essentially outlines the planned movement of a robotic system or mechanism.

Motion profiles are crucial in robotics because they ensure smooth, efficient, and precise movement of robotic arms, actuators, or other mechanisms. By defining the desired motion trajectory in terms of position, velocity, and acceleration, engineers can optimize the performance of robotic systems to meet specific requirements, such as speed, accuracy, and safety.

## Products:
### S-Curve Symmetric Profile

### S-Curve Asymmetric Profile
<figcaption>Variable velocity profiles: Accommodates varying velocity needs throughout the trajectory, optimizing performance for diverse motion control scenarios.</figcaption>
<figcaption>Limited flexibility: Not flexible enough for realtime trajectory generation.</figcaption>

### The Next Step:
1. Realtime Trajectory generation
2. Extend Algorithm to 2D/3D Space
3. Optimize performance

By focusing on real-time trajectory generation, extending the algorithm to multidimensional spaces, and optimizing performance, we can advance the capabilities of our motion control system, enabling agile and precise motion control in complex robotic applications.
